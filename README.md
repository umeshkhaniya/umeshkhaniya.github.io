# [Project 1: Microstate Analysis of Protein](https://github.com/umeshkhaniya/microstate_lysozyme_analysis)

This project invloves the novel way of finding the right protonated state for Molecular Dynamics Simulation. This tool is developed by me and now in use in Gunner Lab. 
* **Python libraries used:** Python3
* **Input:** Microstate file from MCCE output
* **Output:** Protonation state of Protein 

# [Project 2: Drug Discovery using the Machine Learning approach](http://youtube.com/dataprofessor)

This project makes use of ***sentiment analysis*** of cryptocurrency coupled with ***technical analysis*** in the trading of cryptocurrencies.
* **Python libraries used:** Streamlit, python-binance, cctx, talib
* **Input:** Cryptocurrency historical price
* **Output:** Trading signals triggers buying and selling
